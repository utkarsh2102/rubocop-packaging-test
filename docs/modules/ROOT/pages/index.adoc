= RuboCop Packaging

`RuboCop::Packaging` is an extension of [RuboCop](https://rubocop.org/),
which is a Ruby static code analyzer (a.k.a. linter) and code formatter.

It helps enforcing some of the guidelines that are expected of upstream
maintainers so that the downstream can build their packages in a clean
environment without any problems.  
Some of the other basic guidelines can be found
